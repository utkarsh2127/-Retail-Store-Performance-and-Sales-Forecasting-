# Retail Store Performance and Sales Prediction

## 🎯 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing store performance using historical sales data. It identifies sales patterns, trends, and key factors influencing sales, leveraging regression-based predictive models to provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize key trends, seasonality, and anomalies in store sales data.
- 🧮 **Predictive Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - LightGBM
- 🔍 **Insights Generation**: Uncover factors impacting sales performance across different time periods.
- 📈 **Performance Evaluation**: Measure model accuracy using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Python: Core programming language
- pandas & numpy: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
- scikit-learn: Regression models and preprocessing
- XGBoost & LightGBM: Advanced regression models

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
   - Prepare features for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
   - Visualize sales performance and influencing factors.
3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Train regression models to predict future sales based on historical data.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² to assess model performance.

## 🌟 Example
Predict weekly sales for a store using historical data. For example:
- Identify high-performing stores based on predictions.
- Estimate potential sales during holiday periods to adjust inventory levels.
